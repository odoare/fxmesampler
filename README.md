# FxmeSampler

FxmeSampler is a JUCE-based sampling instrument plugin featuring, a flexible multi-channel mixer, built-in convolution reverb, and advanced velocity mapping. All configurations are defined via a portable `mapping.xml` file embedded in the plugin resources.

## Overview

The instrument's architecture is defined by a `mapping.xml` file embedded in the plugin's binary resources. This file controls:
*   **Sample Mapping:** Which samples play on which notes/velocities.
*   **Voice Architecture:** Envelopes (ADSR), looping, and playback modes (One-shot).
*   **Routing:** How samples are routed to mixer channels.
*   **Mixer Layout:** Definition of strips, buses, and effect chains.
*   **UI Customization:** Colors, icons, and welcome screen.

## Building

This project is built using the JUCE framework.

1.  Open the `.jucer` file in the Projucer.
2.  Ensure all audio samples and images referenced in `mapping.xml` are added to the **Binary Data** section in Projucer.
3.  Save the project to generate build files for your IDE (Xcode, Visual Studio, Makefile, etc.).
4.  Build the `FxmeSampler` target.

## Configuration: `mapping.xml`

The `mapping.xml` file is the core configuration file. Below is the complete specification of its structure and attributes.

### Root Element
The root element must be `<Mappings>`.

```xml
<Mappings>
    <!-- Child elements go here -->
</Mappings>
```

### 1. Welcome Tab
Optional. Defines the content for the "Welcome" tab in the UI.

```xml

| `img` | String | Icon resource for the master strip. |
| `color` | String | Color for the strip (format: "r,g,b" or color name). |

### 3. Mixer Configuration
The `<Mixer>` element contains definitions for channel strips and buses.

#### `<Strip>`
Defines a mixer channel strip.

```xml
<Strip type="ambisonicmono" name="Piano_Top" img="piano.jpg" color="148,153,77" effectChain="dynamics"/>
```

**Note:** To prevent feedback loops, a Bus can only send audio to other Buses defined *sequentially after* it in the XML.

### 4. Sample Groups
`<SampleGroup>` elements define shared properties for a set of sounds, such as envelopes and routing.

```xml
<SampleGroup name="Snare" channels="0:6, 1:7" muteGroup="1" midiChannel="10"
             oneShot="false" loop="true" groupLevel="-3.0" minVelocityGain="-20.0"
             attack="0.001" decay="0.2" sustain="0.5" release="0.3" detune="0.0"/>
```

| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `name` | String | Required | Unique identifier for the group. |
| `channels` | String | "0,1" | Output routing. Format: `src:dest` or `dest`. <br>Example: `0:6, 1:7` maps source ch 0 to output 6, source ch 1 to output 7. |

| `groupLevel` | Float | 0.0 | Static gain offset for the entire group in dB. |
| `minVelocityGain` | Float | -40.0 | The gain in dB applied when MIDI velocity is at its minimum (1). This defines the floor of the velocity-to-gain scaling; 0.0 results in fixed volume regardless of velocity. |

### 5. Sounds
`<Sound>` elements define individual samples.

```xml
<Sound name="Snare_Hit" group="Snare" resource="snare.wav" 
       basePitch="60" noteLow="60" noteHigh="60" velLow="0" velHigh="127"

| `loopStart` | Integer | 0 | Sample index for loop start point. |
| `loopEnd` | Integer | -1 | Sample index for loop end point (-1 = sampleEnd). |

## Resource Handling

The plugin loads files from JUCE's `BinaryData`.
1.  **Filenames:** In `mapping.xml`, refer to files by their original filename (e.g., `my sample.wav`).
2.  **Internal Mapping:** The code automatically converts filenames to valid C++ variable names (replacing spaces and dots with underscores) to locate them in `BinaryData`.

# Made with FxmeSampler

## Examplekits folder

In the ExampleKits folder, there are a few small-size projects to show how to use FxmeSampler. For now there are only drum sampler examples, but more will come in the future.

## Black Widow Drums
The **Black Widow Drums** project is the flagship showcase for FxmeSampler's advanced spatial and processing features. Recorded on a Gretsch Black Widow kit, it utilizes a sophisticated microphone array and signal processing chain to deliver a professional, studio-ready drum sound.

### Microphone Configuration
*   **Overheads:** Rode NT-SF1 First-Order Ambisonic microphone, capturing a full 360° sound field.
*   **Kick:** Blue Kick Ball.
*   **Snare/Toms:** Three Shure SM57s (Snare, High Tom, Low Tom).

### Advanced Ambisonic-Mono Routing
Each drum element leverages the **ambisonicmono** hybrid strip. This routes the 4-channel B-Format overhead signal plus the dedicated proximity microphone into a single channel strip. This allows for:
*   **Spatial Sculpting:** Precision control over the elevation, azimuth, and width of the overhead "view" for each specific drum.
*   **The Virtual MS Mic:** The ability to treat the ambisonic field as a virtual Mid-Side pair that can be panned and balanced.
*   **Hybrid Mixing:** An equal-power mix control to blend between the localized spatial field and the punch of the close-mic proximity signal.

### Intelligent Room Modeling
To optimize performance and reduce the plugin's memory footprint, the room sound is not played back from raw multi-channel files. Instead, a **transfer function** was calculated between the omnidirectional (W) component of the ambisonic overheads and the physical room microphones. 

This resulted in high-fidelity **Impulse Responses (IRs)**. The Room channel in the mixer functions as a real-time convolution engine, applying these IRs to the dry signals. This provides an authentic room character while saving gigabytes of sample data.

### Processing & Mix Architecture
*   **Channel Processing:** Every strip features a dedicated effect chain consisting of a **4-band EQ**, **Dynamics (Compressor/Limiter)**, and **Tube Saturation** for harmonic enhancement.
*   **Parallel Compression Bus:** A dedicated stereo bus for "New York style" parallel compression to add weight and density to the kit.
*   **Spatial FX Bus:** A secondary bus hosting a combined **Delay and Convolution Reverb** for additional depth and atmosphere.
